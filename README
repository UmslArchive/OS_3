==========================================

Install :
    `make`

Run :
    `./oss`
    -h for help

Notes :
    The only interrupt signal that is currently handled is the SIGTERM signal.
    (ctrl-c). Memory is cleaned up properly for that signal only. Don't hit
    ctrl-z otherwise you will have to kill -9 ossPID, which you will have to find
    with `ps -e | grep "oss"` then you will have to wipe the shared memory away
    with `ipcrm -M keyVal`

    ONLY USE CTRL-C TO INTERRUPT!
